- Simulate exam conditions for better preparation

---

## 5.1 Creating Self-Assessment Materials

### Generating Practice Questions

The key to effective practice questions is variety and appropriate difficulty:

```
Create a practice test on [TOPIC].

Exam details:
- Subject: [SUBJECT]
- Level: [high school / undergraduate / graduate / professional]
- Format of actual exam: [multiple choice / short answer / essay / mixed]
- Time limit: [X minutes]

Generate:
- [X] multiple choice questions (varying difficulty: easy, medium, hard)
- [X] short answer questions
- [X] one essay question with a rubric

For each question:
1. Include the correct answer (hidden until I ask)
2. Explain why the correct answer is right
3. Explain why each wrong answer is wrong (for MCQ)

After I attempt them, I'll share my answers for feedback.
```

### Questions by Bloom's Taxonomy

Different levels of understanding require different question types:

```
Create questions about [TOPIC] at each level of Bloom's Taxonomy:

1. REMEMBER: Basic recall of facts/terms
2. UNDERSTAND: Explain concepts in your own words
3. APPLY: Use knowledge in new situations
4. ANALYZE: Break down information, find patterns
5. EVALUATE: Make judgments, defend positions
6. CREATE: Combine elements to form something new

Generate 2 questions at each level.
This helps me identify which levels I'm weak at.
```

### Topic-Specific Question Formats

**For Sciences:**
```
Create questions for [SCIENCE TOPIC] including:
- Conceptual questions (explain why/how)
- Calculation problems (show work)
- Diagram interpretation
- Experimental design scenarios
- Compare/contrast related concepts
```

**For History/Social Sciences:**
```
Create questions for [TOPIC] including:
- Timeline/chronology questions
- Cause and effect analysis
- Primary source interpretation
- Compare different perspectives
- "What if" counterfactual scenarios
```

**For Math:**
```
Create practice problems for [MATH TOPIC]:
- Start with a worked example
- Then give me 5 problems of increasing difficulty
- Include one "challenge" problem beyond typical exam level
- Don't show solutions until I attempt them
```

## 5.2 Identifying and Addressing Weak Points

### Post-Quiz Analysis

After any practice session:

```
I just took a practice quiz on [TOPIC].

My results:
- Correct: [LIST]
- Incorrect: [LIST]
- Unsure about: [LIST]

Analyze my performance:
1. What patterns do you see in my mistakes?
2. What underlying concepts am I missing?
3. Which topics should I prioritize reviewing?
4. Create 5 targeted questions to address my weak areas
```

### The Feynman Technique with AI

Test true understanding by teaching:

```
I'm going to explain [CONCEPT] as if teaching it to someone
with no background. Point out:

1. Where my explanation is unclear
2. Where I'm wrong or imprecise
3. What I'm leaving out that's important
4. Where I'm using jargon without explaining it

Don't help me—just identify gaps. I'll try to fix them.

My explanation: [YOUR EXPLANATION]
```

### Gap Analysis Across Topics

```
I'm preparing for an exam covering these topics:
1. [Topic 1]
2. [Topic 2]
3. [Topic 3]
...

For each topic, ask me one diagnostic question.
Based on my answers, rank the topics from "needs most work"
to "strongest" and explain why.
```

### Creating a Remediation Plan

```
Based on my exam performance:
- Score: [X/Y]
- Weak areas: [LIST]
- Time until next attempt: [TIMEFRAME]

Create a focused study plan that:
1. Prioritizes topics by impact on score
2. Identifies prerequisite concepts I might be missing
3. Provides specific practice for each weak area
4. Includes checkpoints to verify improvement
```

---

## 5.3 Memorization and Retention Strategies

### AI-Generated Mnemonics

```
Create memorable mnemonics to help me remember:

Topic: [TOPIC]
Things to remember: [LIST]

For each item:
1. Create an acronym, rhyme, or visual association
2. Explain the connection to the actual content
3. Make it vivid, funny, or absurd (those stick better)
```

### Spaced Repetition Planning

```
I need to memorize [AMOUNT] of material for an exam on [DATE].

Create a spaced repetition schedule:
1. When should I first learn each concept?
2. When should I review it (day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30)?
3. How should reviews differ from initial learning?
4. What should I do if I fail a review?

Include a calendar format I can follow.
```

### Active Recall Exercises

```
Test my recall on [TOPIC]. Don't give me hints.

Ask me 5 questions. After I answer each:
1. Tell me if I'm correct
2. If wrong, don't explain yet—let me try again
3. Only after second attempt, reveal the answer with explanation

This is more effective than re-reading!
```

### The Memory Palace Technique

```
Help me create a memory palace for [LIST OF ITEMS TO REMEMBER].

1. Choose a familiar location (my house, my commute, etc.)
2. For each item, create a vivid image placed at a specific spot
3. Make the images interact with the location
4. Create a story linking them in order

Location I'll use: [YOUR CHOICE]
```

## 5.4 Simulating Exam Conditions

### Timed Practice Sessions

```
I want to simulate exam conditions for [SUBJECT].

Exam format:
- Duration: [X] minutes
- Question types: [TYPES]
- Topics covered: [TOPICS]

Create a realistic practice exam.
I will:
1. Start a timer
2. Not use any aids (unless the real exam allows them)
3. Submit my answers when done

After I submit, grade me and provide feedback on:
- Accuracy
- Time management (did I spend too long on certain questions?)
- Question types I struggled with
```

### Predicting Exam Questions

```
I'm preparing for an exam on [COURSE/SUBJECT].

Based on these materials:
- Textbook chapters: [LIST]
- Lecture topics: [LIST]
- Past exams (if any): [DESCRIBE]
- Professor's emphasis: [WHAT THEY STRESSED]

Predict:
1. The 5 most likely exam topics
2. Likely question formats for each
3. "Wildcard" topics that might appear
4. How to prepare for unexpected questions
```

### Dealing with Exam Anxiety

```
I get anxious during exams, which hurts my performance.

Help me create a pre-exam routine:
1. The night before
2. Morning of the exam
3. First 5 minutes of the exam
4. When I hit a question I can't answer
5. Last 10 minutes review strategy

Include specific calming techniques and practical strategies.
```

## 5.5 Subject-Specific Strategies

### STEM Exams

```
Help me prepare for a [MATH/PHYSICS/CHEMISTRY/BIOLOGY] exam.

My challenges:
- I struggle with: [PROBLEM TYPES]
- Time issue: [DESCRIBE]

Create a study plan that includes:
1. Essential formulas/concepts I must know cold
2. Problem-solving strategies for each type
3. Common traps and how to avoid them
4. How to check my answers efficiently
```

1. Outline template for quick essay structure
2. Key arguments/evidence I should have ready
3. Thesis statement formulas for different prompts
4. How to handle an unexpected prompt
```

### Standardized Tests (SAT, GRE, etc.)

```

Current score: [IF KNOWN]
Target score: [TARGET]
Test date: [DATE]

Create a preparation plan covering:
1. Section-by-section strategy
2. Time allocation per question type
3. When to guess vs. skip
4. High-impact topics to focus on
5. Practice test schedule
```

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Self-Quiz
Generate a 10-question quiz on something you're currently studying. Take it without looking at notes. Analyze which question types were hardest and why.

### Exercise 2: Teach to Learn
Choose a concept you think you understand. Explain it to AI as if teaching a beginner. Have AI identify gaps in your explanation. Fill the gaps and try again.

### Exercise 3: Predict and Prepare
For an upcoming exam, predict what you think will be on it. Generate practice questions for those predictions. After the exam, compare your predictions to what actually appeared.

### Exercise 4: Timed Simulation
Do a full timed practice exam in realistic conditions. After, analyze not just your answers but your time management and stress levels.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Active recall beats re-reading** - Testing yourself is more effective than reviewing notes
2. **Mistakes are data** - Wrong answers show you exactly what to study
3. **Variety matters** - Practice with different question types and difficulty levels
4. **Simulate reality** - Practice in conditions similar to the actual exam
5. **Spaced repetition works** - Spread your studying over time, not cramming
