## 6.1 Presentations and Visual Materials

### Presentation Outline Generator

```
Create an outline for a [LENGTH]-minute presentation on [TOPIC].

Audience: [WHO]
Their prior knowledge: [LEVEL]
Goal: [WHAT THEY SHOULD KNOW/DO AFTER]

Structure:
1. Attention-grabbing opening (what hook would work?)
2. 3-5 key points with supporting details
3. Transitions between sections
4. Memorable conclusion with call to action

For each slide, suggest:
- Headline (key takeaway, not just topic)
- 2-3 bullet points max
- Visual suggestion (chart, image, diagram)
```

### Slide Content by Type

**For Introduction Slides:**
```
Create an opening slide for a presentation on [TOPIC].
Include:
- A hook question or surprising statistic
- Why this topic matters to [AUDIENCE]
- What the presentation will cover (preview)
```

**For Concept Explanation Slides:**
```
Create a slide explaining [CONCEPT] to [AUDIENCE].
- Headline that captures the key insight
- Simple explanation (no jargon)
- One clear visual or analogy
- One example
```

**For Data/Evidence Slides:**
```
I have this data: [DATA]

Create a slide that:
- Has a clear "so what" headline
- Suggests the best chart type to visualize it
- Highlights the key insight
- Includes a brief interpretation
```

**For Conclusion Slides:**
```
Create a closing slide for my presentation on [TOPIC].
Include:
- Summary of 3 key points
- One actionable takeaway
- How to learn more (resources, next steps)
```

### Visual Concept Descriptions

When you need to create images or diagrams:

```
Describe a diagram that would help explain [CONCEPT].

Include:
- What shapes/elements to use
- How they should be arranged
- Labels and annotations
- Color coding suggestions
- What relationships/flows to show

Make it simple enough to sketch by hand or create in PowerPoint.
```

Create a worksheet on [TOPIC] for [AUDIENCE/LEVEL].

Include:
1. Clear instructions at the top
2. Warm-up questions (2-3 easy)
3. Main practice (5-7 questions, increasing difficulty)
4. Challenge question (for fast finishers)
5. Self-reflection prompt at the end

Format for easy printing:
- Leave space for answers
- Number all questions
- Include a name/date line
```

### Different Question Types

**Fill-in-the-Blank:**
```
Create 10 fill-in-the-blank sentences for [TOPIC].
- Each blank tests a key concept or term
- Include a word bank (with 2-3 extra words)
- Answers should not be guessable from context alone
```

**Matching Exercises:**
```
Create a matching exercise for [TOPIC].
Left column: [10 TERMS/CONCEPTS]
Right column: [DEFINITIONS/EXAMPLES]
- Mix up the order
- Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong
```

**Sorting/Categorization:**
```
Create a sorting activity for [TOPIC].
Students should categorize [ITEMS] into [CATEGORIES].
Include:
- 15-20 items to sort
- Clear category definitions
- 2-3 tricky items that could arguably fit multiple categories
```

**Sequence/Order:**
```
Create a sequencing activity about [PROCESS/EVENT].
- 8-10 steps to put in order
- Include one red herring (step that shouldn't be included)
- Provide partial sequence as scaffolding
```

### Answer Keys

```
Create an answer key for the worksheet above.

Include:
- All correct answers
- For each answer, brief explanation of WHY it's correct
- Common mistakes students might make
- Partial credit guidelines (where applicable)
```

## 6.3 Differentiated Materials

### Adapting for Different Levels

**Simplifying Complex Content:**
```
Simplify this content for [YOUNGER/BEGINNER] learners:

Original: [CONTENT]

Simplify by:
1. Shorter sentences
2. More common vocabulary
3. Concrete examples instead of abstract concepts
4. Visual supports
5. Chunked into smaller pieces
```

**Adding Challenge:**
```
Make this content more challenging for [ADVANCED] learners:

Original: [CONTENT]

Add challenge by:
1. Open-ended questions requiring analysis
2. Connections to other topics
3. Real-world application scenarios
4. Primary source analysis
5. Create/design tasks
```

**Multiple Versions:**
```
Create 3 versions of this activity for differentiated instruction:

Topic: [TOPIC]
Activity type: [TYPE]

Version A (Scaffolded):
- More guidance and structure
- Simpler vocabulary
- Worked examples

Version B (Standard):
- Grade-level expectations
- Some guidance
- Mix of question types

Version C (Extended):
- Minimal scaffolding
- Complex scenarios
- Open-ended responses
```

### Adapting for Different Audiences

```
I need to explain [TOPIC] to three different audiences.
For each, adjust:
- Vocabulary and complexity
- Examples and analogies
- Assumed prior knowledge
- What to emphasize

Audiences:
1. [AUDIENCE 1 - e.g., elementary students]
2. [AUDIENCE 2 - e.g., professionals]
3. [AUDIENCE 3 - e.g., general public]
```

## 6.4 AI as Your Teaching Assistant

### Generating Explanations at Multiple Levels

```
Explain [CONCEPT] at three levels of depth:

Level 1 - "Cocktail party" explanation (30 seconds, anyone can understand)
Level 2 - "Textbook summary" explanation (2 minutes, some background assumed)
Level 3 - "Expert detail" explanation (5 minutes, technical accuracy)

I'll use these depending on who I'm teaching.
```

### Creating Analogies

```
Create 3 different analogies for [CONCEPT].

For each analogy:
1. What familiar thing does it compare to?
2. How does the comparison work?
3. Where does the analogy break down?
4. What audience would it work best for?

Make them progressively sophisticated.
```

### Anticipating Student Questions

```
I'm teaching [TOPIC] to [AUDIENCE].

Predict:
1. 5 questions students will likely ask
2. 3 misconceptions they might have
3. Where they'll get confused
4. What prerequisite gaps might cause problems

For each, suggest how I should address it.
```

### Creating Examples

```
Give me 5 examples of [CONCEPT] for teaching purposes.

Include:
1. A simple, classic example
2. A real-world, relatable example
3. A surprising or counterintuitive example
4. An example that shows what it's NOT (near-miss)
5. An example students could recreate themselves
```

### Feedback Templates

```
Create feedback templates I can use when [GRADING TYPE].

For each feedback level:
- Excellent work
- Good but needs improvement
- Needs significant revision

Include:
- What to praise specifically
- What to correct
- How to phrase constructive criticism
- Next steps for improvement
```

---

## 6.5 Interactive and Gamified Content

### Quiz Games

```
Turn [TOPIC] into a quiz game format.

Include:
- 15 questions with point values (easy=1, medium=2, hard=3)
- Fun category names
- A "Daily Double" style high-risk question
- Rules for playing individually or in teams

Make it feel like a game show, not a test.
```

### Learning Games

```
Design a simple learning game for [TOPIC].

Constraints:
- Can be played in [X] minutes
- Minimal materials needed
- Works for [GROUP SIZE]
- Active participation required

Include:
- Clear rules
- Winning conditions
- How learning is embedded in gameplay
- Variations for different skill levels
```

### Interactive Scenarios

```
Create a choose-your-own-adventure scenario for learning [TOPIC].

Starting situation: [DESCRIBE]

At each decision point:
- Present a realistic choice
- 2-3 options that test understanding
- Each choice leads to consequences
- Wrong choices teach through failure, not punishment

Include 3-4 decision points with multiple endings.
```

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: One Topic, Three Formats
Take a concept you know well. Create:
1. A 5-slide presentation outline
2. A 10-question worksheet
3. An interactive game or scenario
Reflect on which format was hardest and why.

### Exercise 2: Differentiation Practice
Create three versions of the same lesson for:
1. A struggling learner
2. A typical learner
3. An advanced learner
Consider what changes between versions.

### Exercise 3: Analogy Bank
Pick 5 difficult concepts from a subject you're teaching or learning. Create at least 2 analogies for each. Test them on someone to see which resonate.

### Exercise 4: Student Perspective
Have AI roleplay as a confused student. Try to explain a concept while AI asks clarifying questions and expresses misunderstandings. This reveals gaps in your explanations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structure before details** - Start with outlines, then fill in content
2. **Visuals support understanding** - But must be purposeful, not decorative
3. **Differentiation is essential** - One size never fits all
4. **Anticipate confusion** - Plan for questions and misconceptions
5. **Active beats passive** - Worksheets and games engage more than lectures
