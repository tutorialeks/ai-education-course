---

## 7.1 Understanding AI Limitations

### What AI Gets Wrong

AI language models have fundamental limitations you must understand:

**1. Hallucinations (Confident Fabrication)**
AI can generate plausible-sounding but completely false information:
- Fake citations to non-existent papers
- Invented statistics and quotes
- Made-up historical events
- Incorrect technical information stated confidently

**2. Training Data Cutoff**
- AI knowledge has a cutoff date (varies by model)
- Recent events, research, or changes may be missing
- "Current" information requires web search tools

**3. Lack of True Understanding**
- AI predicts likely text, not truth
- Cannot verify its own claims
- Doesn't "know" it's wrong

**4. Biases**
- Reflects biases in training data
- May underrepresent certain perspectives
- Can reinforce stereotypes

### When to Be Extra Careful

| Domain | Risk Level | Why |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Medical/health advice | HIGH | Could cause harm |
| Legal information | HIGH | Jurisdiction-specific, high stakes |
| Financial advice | HIGH | Personal circumstances matter |
| Current events | MEDIUM | Training cutoff |
| Scientific claims | MEDIUM | Hallucinated citations |
| Historical facts | MEDIUM | Can confabulate details |
| Math calculations | MEDIUM | Makes arithmetic errors |
| Personal opinions | LOW | Subjective anyway |
| Creative writing | LOW | Accuracy less critical |

### Verification Strategies

```
I need to verify information AI provided about [TOPIC].

Help me:
1. Identify claims that need verification
2. Suggest authoritative sources to check
3. Show me how to cross-reference
4. Flag anything that looks suspicious
```

**Quick verification habits:**
- Google specific facts and statistics
- Check citations actually exist
- Look for multiple independent sources
- Be suspicious of precise-sounding numbers
- Ask AI "How confident are you about this?"

## 7.2 Academic Integrity in the AI Era

### What Counts as Academic Misconduct?

Different institutions have different policies. Generally:

**Usually Prohibited:**
- Submitting AI-generated work as entirely your own
- Using AI on exams where it's not allowed
- Having AI write your thesis/dissertation
- Using AI to circumvent learning objectives

**Usually Allowed (with disclosure):**
- Using AI to brainstorm or outline
- Grammar and spelling checks
- Getting explanations of concepts
- Generating practice problems to study

**Gray Areas (check your policy):**
- AI-assisted editing and revision
- Using AI to summarize sources
- Code generation for programming assignments
- Translation assistance

### How to Check Your Institution's Policy

```
Help me understand AI policies. For my context:
- Institution type: [university/high school/professional certification]
- Assignment type: [essay/code/exam/project]

What questions should I ask my instructor to clarify:
1. What AI use, if any, is permitted?
2. How should AI use be disclosed?
3. What counts as "your own work"?
4. Are there penalties for undisclosed AI use?
```

### Ethical Use Framework

Ask yourself before using AI:

1. **Is it allowed?**
   - Check course/institution policy
   - When in doubt, ask

2. **Am I learning?**
   - Am I developing the skills this assignment targets?
   - Could I do this without AI if needed?

3. **Am I being honest?**
   - Would I be comfortable if my instructor knew how I used AI?
   - Am I misrepresenting my abilities?

4. **Am I adding value?**
   - Is AI helping me create better work, or replacing my thinking?
   - Am I critically evaluating AI output?

---

## 7.3 Proper Citation and Disclosure

### When to Disclose AI Use

**Always disclose when:**
- AI contributed substantial content or ideas
- You're required to by policy
- The reader would assume the work is entirely human-written

**May not need disclosure for:**
- Basic spelling/grammar tools
- Search engines (even AI-powered)
- General information gathering

### How to Cite AI

Different style guides have different recommendations. Here are common approaches:

**APA Style (7th ed.):**
```
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Version GPT-4o) [Large language model].
https://chat.openai.com

In-text: (OpenAI, 2025)
```

**MLA Style (9th ed.):**
```
"[Prompt text]" prompt. ChatGPT, version GPT-4o, OpenAI,
15 Jan. 2025, chat.openai.com.
```

**Chicago Style:**
```
OpenAI, ChatGPT, response to "[your prompt]," January 15, 2025,
https://chat.openai.com.
```

### Disclosure Statement Template

```
AI Disclosure Statement

This [paper/project/assignment] was created with assistance from
[AI Tool Name]. The AI was used for:
- [Specific use 1: e.g., "brainstorming initial ideas"]
- [Specific use 2: e.g., "generating first draft of section X"]
- [Specific use 3: e.g., "proofreading and grammar checking"]

All AI-generated content was reviewed, verified, and substantially
edited by the author. The final work represents my own understanding
and conclusions.
```

## 7.4 AI Detection and Its Limitations

### How AI Detection Works

AI detection tools look for:
- Statistical patterns typical of AI text
- Perplexity scores (predictability of word choices)
- Burstiness (variation in sentence complexity)
- Unusual consistency in writing quality

### Why Detection Is Unreliable

**False positives:** Human writing flagged as AI
- Non-native English speakers
- Formal/technical writing
- Writing about common topics

**False negatives:** AI writing not detected
- Heavily edited AI content
- AI prompted to write "naturally"
- Mixed human-AI content

**The reality (2025-2026):**
- Detection accuracy is 60-80% at best
- High false positive rates
- Easily fooled by paraphrasing
- Cannot prove AI use

### What This Means for You

1. **Don't rely on detection to protect you**
   - If you use AI inappropriately, getting caught is a risk
   - But not getting caught doesn't make it ethical

2. **Don't fear false positives**
   - If accused wrongly, explain your process
   - Keep notes/drafts showing your work

3. **Focus on learning, not gaming detection**
   - The goal is developing skills, not passing detection

---

## 7.5 Building AI-Resistant Skills

Skills that remain valuable regardless of AI advancement:

### Critical Thinking
- Evaluating arguments and evidence
- Identifying assumptions and biases
- Synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Forming original judgments

**Practice:**
```
Give me an argument about [TOPIC].
I will:
1. Identify the main claim
2. Evaluate the evidence
3. Find weaknesses
4. Consider counterarguments
5. Form my own conclusion

Then critique my analysis.
```

### Deep Understanding
- Connecting concepts across domains
- Explaining "why" not just "what"
- Applying knowledge to novel situations
- Teaching others effectively

**Practice:**
```
Test whether I truly understand [CONCEPT]:
1. Have me explain it without jargon
2. Give me a novel scenario to apply it
3. Ask me to connect it to [DIFFERENT FIELD]
4. Point out gaps in my understanding
```

### Communication Skills
- Clear, persuasive writing with personal voice
- Active listening and questioning
- Adapting message to audience
- Building relationships

### Creativity and Judgment
- Defining problems worth solving
- Making decisions with incomplete information
- Taking appropriate risks
- Leading and inspiring others

### Human-Specific Abilities
- Empathy and emotional intelligence
- Physical presence and body language
- Lived experience and personal stories
- Ethical reasoning in complex situations

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Fact-Check Challenge
Ask AI for 10 facts about a topic you know well. Verify each one. How many were accurate? What types of errors did you find?

### Exercise 2: Bias Detection
Ask AI the same question from different perspectives:
- "[Topic] from a conservative viewpoint"
- "[Topic] from a progressive viewpoint"
Compare responses. What biases do you notice?

### Exercise 3: Ethics Scenario
```
Present me with 3 scenarios where a student might use AI
in ways that are:
1. Clearly ethical
2. Clearly unethical
3. Ambiguous/debatable

I'll reason through each and you'll critique my thinking.
```

### Exercise 4: Skills Audit
List 10 skills you're developing in your current studies. For each:
- How might AI affect this skill's value in 5 years?
- What should you do differently in response?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI lies confidently** - Always verify important information
2. **Policies vary** - Know your institution's rules
3. **Disclosure builds trust** - Be transparent about AI use
4. **Detection is imperfect** - Ethics matter more than evading detection
5. **Human skills remain valuable** - Develop what AI can't do
